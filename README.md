# Football Project

---

## This project is made as an assignment for CS course 'Introduction to modern programming'

Author: _Daniils Firgers_

### Project setup

- use `npm install` to install required packages
- use `npm run serve` to start the development project on port 8080
- use `npm start` to start the server on port 3000

### Caveats

1. JSON files with football games are neccesary to run the project
2. Need to add environment variable `FOOTBALL_DATA'` which is a path to the folder with JSON files
